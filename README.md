The file 'roman-amphitheaters.geojson' holds the latest information and is the source for other derived files, including 'roman-amphitheaters.csv'. The 'utility.ipynb' generates these other files.

Discussion of one approach to using this data, with links to interactive code, is available in the article: S. Heath. 2021. "Applied Use of JSON, GeoJSON, JSON-LD, SPARQL, and IPython Notebooks for Representing and Interacting with Small Datasets. In S. E. Bond, P. Dilley, and R. Horne, eds. . *Linked Open Data for the Ancient Mediterranean: Structures, Practices, Prospects*. ISAW Papers 20. <http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/20-13/>.

Note: I have made small steps towards implementing the bibliographic infrastructure for this dataset in Zotero. See https://www.zotero.org/groups/2900686/roman_amphitheaters . The number of titles currently included there is very small and only slowly growing. But growing nonetheless. The 'roman-amphitheaters.geojson' files will sometimes have bibliographic citations and the Zotero item identifier. The .csv file will sometimes have the first Zotero identifier. It is a goal to make an html rendering of this information that includes working links directly to the online versioni of the Zotero items.
